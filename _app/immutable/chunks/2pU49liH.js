This could mean Cyn isn’t truly gone and may return.</p> <h3>Second Verse</h3> <p>The lyrics state: <em>“Eat my heart, take my soul, let it burn you/ I won’t let go/ What’s on my mind? Well, I’m the farthest gone, you’ll find/ You should take a look inside.”</em></p> <p>Cyn shows how once Uzi swallows her, she isn’t going to leave. She also taunts Uzi by telling her that she should look inside herself for the Solver, as they are now one.</p> <h3>Bridge</h3> <p>Finally, during the bridge, Cynessa says <em>“We won’t let them know”</em> - mimicking when she says to N <em>“It’s okay N, I haven’t been honest with V yet.”</em></p> <p>This might mean that Cynessa is partially in control of Uzi, and Uzi, for some reason, is not revealing it (she could be being forced to not reveal it).</p> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>This song adds so much depth to the finale and opens up possibilities for the story continuing. What do you think? Could Cyn still be influencing Uzi?</p> <p><strong>Tell me your thoughts in the comments!</strong></p> <hr/> <p><em>Watch “Bite Me” by AJDspirito on YouTube and let us know what hidden meanings you discovered!</em></p>",1);function c(e){var t=a();n(40),o(e,t)}export{c as default,i as metadata};
