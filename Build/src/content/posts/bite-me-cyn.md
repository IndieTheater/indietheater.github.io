"Bite Me" by AJDspirito just released on YouTube and, as I listened to it, I realized a few things:

## Key Discoveries

- **The song is sung from the point of view of Cynessa/the Absolute Solver** (or Cynessa and J together)
- **The song implies that Season 2 is very much possible**
- **The song shows that Cynessa wanted Uzi to eat her heart/core**
- **Cartoon Universe on YouTube discovered that Cynessa really, really liked N** - and this song confirms that even further

## Detailed Analysis

### First Verse

During the first verse it says *"As she waits at dawn, lookin' for a way to escape her lonely heart."* 

As the song is from the point of Cynessa, this shows that Cynessa wanted to be with N but, as Uzi and N are (now officially) dating, she is unable to, and so wants to "escape."

Also during verse 1, Cynessa says *"Let them swallow you"* - hinting that her plan was to get swallowed by Uzi (to be with N or to bide her time for revenge).

### Chorus - Season 2 Hint?

During the chorus, this line is sung: *"I'm not done, believe me"* - hinting at a possible Season 2. This could mean Cyn isn't truly gone and may return.

### Second Verse

The lyrics state: *"Eat my heart, take my soul, let it burn you/ I won't let go/ What's on my mind? Well, I'm the farthest gone, you'll find/ You should take a look inside."*

Cyn shows how once Uzi swallows her, she isn't going to leave. She also taunts Uzi by telling her that she should look inside herself for the Solver, as they are now one.

### Bridge

Finally, during the bridge, Cynessa says *"We won't let them know"* - mimicking when she says to N *"It's okay N, I haven't been honest with V yet."* 

This might mean that Cynessa is partially in control of Uzi, and Uzi, for some reason, is not revealing it (she could be being forced to not reveal it).

## Conclusion

This song adds so much depth to the finale and opens up possibilities for the story continuing. What do you think? Could Cyn still be influencing Uzi?
