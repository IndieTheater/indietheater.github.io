Bite Me by AJDspirito just released on YouTube and, as I listened to it, I realized a few things:
• The song is sung from the point of Cynessa/the Absolute Solver or Cynessa and J.
• The song implies that Season 2 is very much possible.
• The song also shows that Cynessa wanted Uzi to eat her heart/core
• Cartoon Universe on YouTube discovered that Cynessa really, really liked N and this song confirms that even further.
proof:
• during the first verse it says "As she waits at dawn, lookin' for a way to
escape her lonely heart." As the song is from the point of Cynessa, this shows that Cynessa wanted to be with N but, as Uzi and N are (now officially) dating, she is unable to, and so wants to "escape."

• also during verse 1, Cynessa says "Let them swallow you" hinting that her plan was to get swallowed by Uzi (to be with N or to bide her time for revenge).
• during the chorus, this line is sung "I'm not done, believe me," hinting at a possible season 2.
• During the second verse, it says  "Eat my heart, take my soul, let it burn you/ I won’t let go/ What’s on my mind? Well, I'm the farthest/ gone, you’ll find/ You should take a look inside." Cyn shows how once Uzi swallows her, she isn't going to leave and/or leave. She also taunts Uzi by telling her that she should look inside herself for the solver as they are now one.
• Finally, during the bridge, Cynessa says "We won't let them know" mimicking when she says to N "It's okay N, I haven't been honest with V yet." This might mean that Cynessa is partially in control of Uzi, and Uzi, for some reason, is not revealing it (she could be being forced to not reveal it)

Well, that was fun!
