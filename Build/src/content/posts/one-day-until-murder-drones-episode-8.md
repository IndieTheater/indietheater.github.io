# It's Finally Here!

The long-awaited final episode of the underrated series Murder Drones is releasing **tomorrow**!!!

## Theories 

Some theories about the plot of the episode include:

- We’ll probably learn more about N’s relationship with J over the course of the season, which could potentially reveal surprising details about their dynamic and history.
- Uzi and Nori might meet each other in space.
- Either Thad, Lizzy or Khan will die or get injured (probably in the fight against J?).
- V is probably still alive. She might appear near the middle of the episode to the others or at the beginning to N.
- Season 2 has a high chance of happening!!!!!!
- There will be a space fight between N, Uzi, Cynessa, and J (and possibly V).
- Uzi will witness something traumatic: possibly either Khan or Nori’s death?
- In episode 1, V says “Promise me you and that purple thing will stop prying into that stuff.” This could possibly mean that in this episode, V and J might side with Cynessa against N and Uzi.
- Khan might try to explore the Cabin Fever labs and come across a devastated N.
- This episode might find everyone returning to the bunker and fighting.
- We could see more Nori and Yeva flashbacks.
